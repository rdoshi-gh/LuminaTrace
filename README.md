# LuminaTrace
LuminaTrace is an innovative, AI-powered LED strip diagnostic device that rapidly identifies and maps individual LED failures across entire strips.

Hand-held device
Check each LED to see what colors on the RGB are working using light sensor.
The sensors are connected to Raspbery pi that interprets the data, and then outputs info on each LED, stating whether or not it is functional.
